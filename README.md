# Testing-Triangle-Classification
HW 00b: Testing Triangle Classification

# What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any? 
  * I found it difficult to create test cases. I have always manually tested my code by plugging different accounts in and checking if that worked. So, working with Pytest was new and a bit challenging. Also, there was a lack of direction or the amount of testing needed for our testing. 

# What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
  * The lack of requirement specification made it harder to know how much testing we needed. 

# What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
  * It wasn't easy to get Pytest to test my code. I had to watch a few tutorials to help me. 

# Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done? 
  * I made a test case for each requirement: equilateral, isosceles, scalene, and right triangles. I also changed each test case to 0 to see if it would fail.
